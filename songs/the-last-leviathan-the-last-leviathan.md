Chorus:
My soul has been torn from me and I am bleeding
My heart it has been rent and I am crying
For the beauty around me pales and I am screaming
I am the last of the Great Whales and I am dying.
Last night I heard the cry of my last companion
The roar of the harpoon gun, then I was alone
I reflected on days gone by when we were thousands.
I know why I soon must die the last leviathan.

This morning the sun did rise crimson in the north sky
The ice was the colour of blood and the wind ádid sigh
I rose to take a breath it was my last one
From the gun came the roar of death and now I am gone

And e'er since time began we have been haunted
Through the oceans that were our home we have been hunted
From Eskimos in canoes to mighty whalers
Still you ignored our plea none came to save us

Now that we're no more, there's no more hunting
The big feller is now gone there's no use lamenting
What race is next in line all for the slaughter?
The elephant or the seal or your sons and daughters?

Louis Killen sings The Last Leviathan

My soul has been torn from me and I am bleeding.
My heart it has been rent and I am crying.
As the beauty around me fades and I am screaming.
I am the last of the Great Whales and I am dying.

Last night I heard the song of my last companion,
The blast from the harpoon gun and I swam alone.
I reflect on the days gone by when we were thousands.
I know why I soon must die the last leviathan.

This morning the sun arose in a crimson North sky.
The ice was the colour of blood and the heard the wind sigh.
I rose to take a breath, it was my last one.
From a gun came the roar of death and now I'm all done.

(repeat first verse)

And now we are all gone, there'll be no more hunting.
The big fellow is no more and there is no use lamenting.
What race will be next in line all for the slaughter?
The elephant or the seals or your sons and daughters?
